    <h1>Home made Juice</h1>
        <p>Humans are frugivore species so fruits are our natural source of energy. </p>
        <p>Natural raw juice that is not pasteurized and not fortified with chemical substances is nourishing for our body. </p>
        <p>Juice is a simple way for us to absorb nutrients and also cleanse the inside of the body of waste build-up. </p>
        <p>By consuming real juice as part of my daily lifestyle, I heal and maintain a youthful body free from chronic illnesses. </p>
        <p>Most of the juices sold in groceries are either pasteurized or filled with synthetics, so they damage the body. </p>
        <p>I decided to purchase a juicer and make yummy drinks myself. </p>

    <h2> Green Juice </h2>
        <p>I often make celery juice with apples and cilantro added into the mix.</p>
        <p>Celery is a powerful detoxing herb that cleans deeply inside the body.</p>
        <p>If anyone wants to heal any ailments, celery in juice form is the go-to long term solution. </p>

    <h2> Orange Juice </h2>
        <p>Who doesn't like orange juice? Real natural raw freshly squeezed orange juice!</p>

    <h2> Variety of juices and jelly </h2>
        <p> I also juice blueberries and strawberries separately, beside my green juice. </p>

    <h2> Fruit bowl </h2>
        <p> Aside from juicing, I also make smoothie fruit bowl. </p>
        <p> Typically, shops use acai as a base. Here I am using freshly blended blueberry banana base. </p>
        <p> Then I added whole fruit bananas and blueberries as toppings. </p>
        <p> I may mix things up and add dates in the blended base, or seeds as toppings with honey on top. </p>
