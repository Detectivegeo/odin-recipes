Experimenting a formal website

Today is 2024. I am in my 30s and am learning web development via The Odin Project. This is all new to me. I am almost 50% through the Foundations Course. Let's put into practice what I have learned thus far.

From the top of my mind, this is what I am reviewing:
- Command line terminal
- Basic Git commands
- HTML Boilerplate
- Adding attributes to HTML elements
- Understand head section
- Create paragraphs in body section
- Understand ordered vs. unordered lists
- Distinguish absolute and relative links
- Practice safety precaution using noopener and noreferrer
- Insert image

I may be missing some items here. I will write a self-reflection and include in it whatever I have missed, By discussing what I have learned and practiced, I reinforce my knowledge on applying these basic tools.
